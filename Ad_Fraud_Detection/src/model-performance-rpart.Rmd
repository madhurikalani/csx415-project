## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Loading the Project

```{r p0, echo =FALSE}

setwd("C:/Users/akash/Documents/Madhuri stuff/Data_Science_Intro_R/Ad_Fraud_Detection")
load.proje(file="temp.RData")
library('tree')
library('rpart')


```

## Model Training using rpart

The rpart package in R provides a powerful framework for growing classification trees.

```{r c1}

#Tree Model to Classify - rpart

treefit <- rpart(is_attributed~ip + app + os + device + channel + click_time , method = "class", data = train.sample)

# Results of Model Training
printcp(treefit)

# Plotting the Trained Model
plotcp(treefit)

# Summary of Trained Model
summary(treefit)

# The prune function is used to simplify the tree based on a cp identified from the graph or printed output threshold.

treefit2<-prune(treefit, cp = 0.02)

printcp(tfit2)


save.image(file="temp.RData")

```

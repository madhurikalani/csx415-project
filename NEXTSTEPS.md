## Model Assetment

### Results of Logistic Regression

The glm function was able to predict whether the user actually downloaded the mobile application or not, i.e. is_attributed = 1. But the results were not as good as seen in the training data set. As per the results, accuracy was 99% and error less than 1%.

### Results of Decison Tree using rpart

The model was not showing any results as it was not able to form a tree and depict which are the independent variables. Please see the model-performance-rpart.HTML in reports for details.

### Next Steps

I would need to implement other models and do a comparative study of which model is performing better and most suitable for my problem.

I would be implementing KNN and Random Forest for my future study.
